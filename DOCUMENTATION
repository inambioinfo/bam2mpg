       This script uses samtools to process a BAM formatted file (http://sam-
       tools.sourceforge.net) and call genotypes and confidence scores across
       a covered region.

       For a set of aligned allele observations, the MPG ("Most Probable Geno-
       type") algorithm is used to calculate the posterior probability of
       every possible diploid genotype (or single-allele genotypes for regions
       specified with the --single_copy option, e.g., on the non-PAR regions
       of the X and Y chromosome in a male).  The statistical model uses base
       quality scores to calculate the probability of base-calling errors, and
       assumes a single prior probability for any non-homozygous-reference
       genotype.

MMPPGG IINNPPUUTT
       The first argument to bam2mpg is the path of a fasta-formatted file for
       the reference sequence.  This fasta file must have a corresponding sam-
       tools index file with the same name except for an appended ".fai".

       The second argument to bam2mpg is the path of a BAM-formatted file of
       aligned sequencing reads.  This file must be sorted and indexed using
       samtools prior to running bam2mpg.

MMPPGG OOUUTTPPUUTT
       If no vcf file is specified (either by --snv_vcf or --div_vcf options,
       see below), and no mpg file is specified (using the --mpg option, see
       below), the standard output of the program will contain "MPG" lines
       with nine tab-separated fields.  These fields are:

       vvaarriiaanntt ttyyppee
            The variant type can be "MPG_SNV", which indicates a single base
            change at the position specified by the second and third fields,
            or "MPG_DIV" which indicates a deletion or insertion occurring
            between the "flanking" positions separated by a colon in the third
            field.

       cchhrroommoossoommee
            This is the name of the entry in the fasta reference sequence
            passed as the first argument (and of the matching reference entry
            in the BAM file).

       ppoossiittiioonn
            For an SNV, the position reported is the actual position of the
            nucleotide change.  For DIV’s, this field contains a colon-sepa-
            rated pair of positions, which represent the flanking positions
            surrounding the largest variable region in the sequence.  So, for
            example, in a variable-length run of T’s, the flanking positions
            would be the positions of the non-T characters outside of the run,
            and the alleles reported in the fourth and fifth fields would be
            the T’s between these flanking positions.

       rreeffeerreennccee aalllleellee
            This is the base or bases seen in the reference sequence either at
            the specified position (for an SNV) or between the reported flank-
            ing positions (for a DIV).  When the flanking positions are
            adjacent, so there are no bases between them, a "*" is reported to
            enable splitting on white space rather than tabs.

       ggeennoottyyppee
            The genotype reported is the genotype with the highest posterior
            probability according to Bayes theorem, given the observed reads
            and quality scores, according to the program’s error model.  For
            SNV’s, the two alleles are concatenated, so, for example "AT"
            indicates one A and one T.  For DIV’s, the two alleles are sepa-
            rated by a colon, with a "*" indicating an allele of zero bases.

            When the --single_copy option is used, single allele genotypes are
            reported, so no colon-separation is used in the DIV.  This lack of
            a colon in MPG_DIV genotypes, as well as a single-character geno-
            type at MPG_SNV positions, is what distinguishes "single_copy"
            output.

       MMPPGG ssccoorree
            The MPG score field contains the difference between the natural
            logarithms of the most probable and second most probable geno-
            type’s probabilities, and is therefore an indicator of the proba-
            bility the reported genotype is correct.  So, for example, a score
            of 10 would imply that the reported genotype was approximately
            22,000 times as probable as the next most probable genotype.
            Since bam2mpg will call genotypes at any base position, variant or
            not, we recommend using a score cutoff of 10 to avoid a high level
            of false positive predictions of variation.

       rreeff//nnoonn--rreeff ffiieelldd
            This field is 0 for a homozygous-reference genotype, and 1 for
            anything else, allowing easy extraction of non-reference genotype
            lines with "awk".

       ccoovveerraaggee
            This field reports the number of reads used to calculate the most
            probable genotype.  It does not include bases that have been fil-
            tered for quality (with --qual_filter) or reads beyond the 200
            maximum reads the program allows.

       MMPPVV ssccoorree
            The MPV score reports the difference between the natural loga-
            rithms of the most probable and the homozygous reference genotype,
            and is therefore an indicator of the probability that the posi-
            tion’s true genotype is something other than homozygous reference
            (although not a phred-scaled indicator).

       ----rreeggiioonn _c_h_r_:_s_t_a_r_t_-_e_n_d
            This option specifies a region as a reference entry optionally
            followed by a position range, and causes variants to be called
            only in that region.

       ----qquuaall__ffiilltteerr _m_i_n_i_m_u_m___q_u_a_l_i_t_y
            This option specifies a minimum base quality score necessary for a
            base to be included in the calculation for a particular aligned
            position.  Bases with quality scores below this value will be com-
            pletely ignored.  At GTB, bam2mpg is almost always run with
            --qual_filter 20. (Default: 0)

       ----ssiinnggllee__ccooppyy _c_h_r_1_:_s_t_a_r_t_1_-_e_n_d_1_,_c_h_r_2_:_s_t_a_r_t_2_-_e_n_d_2
            This option specifies regions for which only a single copy exists
            in the genome, so that only one allele is expected to be seen.
            The regions should be comma-separated without spaces, and in the
            same format as expected by the --region option.

       ----iinnddeellss
            This flag option causes the script to skip SNV predictions and
            only report DIV variants.

       ----nnoo__iinnddeellss
            This flag option causes the script to skip DIV predictions and
            only report SNV variants.

       ----oolldd__iinnddeellss
            This flag option causes the script to use averaged quality scores
            across indels rather than inflated scores which are increased pro-
            portional to the length of the indel.  NOTE: This option is cur-
            rently inactive as "old_indels" has become the default until I
            investigate the new indel calling more carefully.

       ----oonnllyy__nnoonnrreeff
            This flag option causes the script to only print lines that pre-
            dict genotypes that are non homozygous reference.

       ----aalliiggnn__bbiiaass _b_i_a_s___v_a_l_u_e
            This option specifies an additional expected percentage of aligned
            bases that are expected to be the reference allele due to bias in
            the alignment favoring the reference base.  For example, if the
            alignment bias has value .05, mpg will expect a GT heterozygous
            position with reference base "G" to have roughly 55% G’s aligned
            at that position, and 45% T’s.  It can also be used to tilt the
            expected percentages due to included probe sequence, which will
            always be reference, but in the long run it would be better to
            have a position-dependent alignment bias that only changed these
            expected values where the probes are located.  (Default: 0)

       ----bbaamm__ffiilltteerr _’_b_a_m _f_i_l_t_e_r _o_p_t_i_o_n_s_’
            Specifies filters to apply to the "samtools view" command, to
            limit the SAM alignments that are processed by bam2mpg.  Potential
            filtering options include the mapping quality (-qNN), "proper
            pair" flag (-f2), and duplicate flag (-F1024).  The default is to
            exclude unmapped reads (-F4); if you supply your own filter, be
            sure to include this value in the "-F" flag, e.g. by adding
            4+512+1024=1540 to exclude unmapped reads, QC failures, and dupli-
            cate reads.  It is advisable to always use quotes around the
            options, and is required when there are spaces between options,
            e.g. '-q20 -F 1540'.

       ----ddss__ccoovveerraaggee _m_i_n___b_a_s_e_s
            This option specifies a minimum number of bases that must be seen
            on each strand for that base’s counts to be included in the proba-
            bility calculation.  For example, if -ds_coverage is specified as
            1, and an aligned "T" is observed multiple times on the forward
            strand, but never on the reverse strand, no T’s will be included
            in the calculation because T was not seen at least once on the
            reverse strand.  This option is dangerous in that it can artifi-
            cially amplify scores by eliminating errors, so its use is dis-
            couraged.

       ----uussee__sseeeedd _s_e_e_d _v_a_l_u_e
            This option sets the random seed to the specified value at the
            beginning of the run.  Perl’s rand function is used for choosing a
            subset of reads at a position when the depth of coverage exceeds
            200.

       ----nnooccaacchhee
            This flag option prevents bam2mpg from caching the SNV genotype
            calls it sees at each site.  This caching is meant to speed up
            run-time when genotypes are being called genome-wide, but because
            the caching doesn’t consider exact base qualities, it can lead to
            slightly inaccurate scoring (but generally not actual genotype
            errors, especially when --qual_filter is used).

       ----ssaamm__ffiilltteerr _"_u_n_i_x _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_"
            The specified command is applied as a filter between the "samtools
            view" and "samtools pileup" commands.  This means that your com-
            mand should expect SAM format, and should print SAM format lines
            for alignments that pass your filter criteria.  Default is no
            additional filtering (but see "--bam_filter").  If your filter can
            be accomplished with options to "samtools view", using "--bam_fil-
            ter" will be more efficient.

       ----ppiilleeuupp__ffiilltteerr _"_p_i_l_e_u_p _o_p_t_i_o_n_s_"
            The specified options are appended to the call to "samtools
            mpileup".  By default, -B is applied, since it looks as if BAQ
            quality scores hurt sensitivity.  Anything specified with the
            --pileup_filter option will supersede the -B option (i.e., -B will
            not be applied if --pileup_filter is used, and -B is not included
            in the option.

       ----ssnnvv__vvccff _"_p_a_t_h _o_f _S_N_V _V_C_F _f_i_l_e _t_o _w_r_i_t_e_"
            This option specifies the path of a VCF file to be written con-
            taining MPG genotypes in VCF format.  If the filename ends in
            ".gz" or ".bgz", the program will attempt to pipe the VCF string
            to "bzip2" before printing.

            This option specifies the path of a VCF file to be written con-
            taining MPG genotypes in VCF format.  If the filename ends in
            ".gz" or ".bgz", the program will attempt to pipe the VCF string

            This option specifies the path of an MPG file to be written con-
            taining genotypes in MPG format.  If the filename ends in ".gz",
            the program will attempt to pipe the VCF string to "gzip" before
            printing.
