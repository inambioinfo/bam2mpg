h1. Bam2mpg

p. The program "bam2mpg" calls genotypes from sequence reads of haploid or diploid DNA 
aligned to a closely-related reference sequence. The program reads alignments in BAM 
format (http://samtools.sourceforge.net). The MPG (Most Probable Genotype) algorithm 
is based on a Bayesian model which simulates sampling from one or two alleles with 
sequencing error, and then calculates the likelihood of each possible genotype given 
the observed sequence data. Using prior probabilities dependent on the expected 
heterozygosity of the sequence, MPG then predicts the "Most Probable Genotype" at each 
site, along with quality scores estimating the accuracy of the calls.

p. Bam2mpg was written by Nancy Fisher Hansen, a staff scientist in the Genome Technology 
Branch (GTB) of NHGRI, an institute at the National Institutes of Health.  Nancy can
